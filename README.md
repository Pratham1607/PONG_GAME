# PONG_GAME
Pong is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to make the ball pass your opponent's paddle.
This project demonstrates basic game development concepts using web technologies. The game includes a moving ball, player-controlled paddle, and a scoring system.
